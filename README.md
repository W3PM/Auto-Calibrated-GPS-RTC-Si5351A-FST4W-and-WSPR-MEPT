# Auto-Calibrated-GPS-RTC-Si5351A-FST4W-and-WSPR-MEPT
This Manned Experimental Propagation Transmitter (MEPT) uses the very popular Arduino Nano and Si5351A clock generator board to generate LF â€“ 10 meter FST4W or WSPR signals. Frequency and time accuracy are maintained by a highly accurate temperature compensated DS3231 real time clock (RTC) board or by using a GPS receiver.
